# 📘 DSA Concepts – Simple Definitions

A beginner-friendly glossary of all the core data structures and algorithms used in this repository.

---

## 🔢 Array

An array is a list of values stored in a single variable.  
Each value can be accessed using its index.

🧠 Example:  
`[10, 20, 30]` — 10 is at index `0`, 20 at `1`, 30 at `2`.

---

## 🔁 Bubble Sort

A simple sorting algorithm that compares each pair of elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order. It keeps doing this until the array is sorted.

📌 Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`  
📌 Space Complexity: `O(1)`

🧠 Real-world analogy: Sorting a deck of cards by comparing one card at a time.

---

## 🔍 Binary Search

Used to search for an element in a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

📌 Time Complexity: `O(log n)`  
📌 Space Complexity: `O(1)`

🧠 Analogy: Looking for a word in a dictionary by opening in the middle, then narrowing down.

---

## 📚 Stack

A **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** data structure.  
You can only add (`push`) or remove (`pop`) the most recently added item.

🧠 Analogy: A stack of plates — you remove the top plate first.

---

## 🔗 Linked List

A list of nodes, where each node stores data and a reference (pointer) to the next node.

🧠 Analogy: A train where each carriage points to the next.

---

## 🧠 Time Complexity

Indicates how fast an algorithm runs depending on the input size `n`.  
Examples:
- `O(1)` – Constant time (super fast)
- `O(n)` – Linear time (grows with input)
- `O(n^2)` – Slower, nested loops

---

## 💾 Space Complexity

How much memory (RAM) an algorithm uses based on input size.
